# Mortality_calculation
This repository showcases the process followed to calculate mortality for a given dataset. The dataset is private therefore hidden. The notebook contains calculations,functions and or processes that can be used in other data analysis tasks. It may look simple but the process is complex. One of my greatest tasks in data analysis that I am proud of.
